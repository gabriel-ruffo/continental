Programmatic representation of Continental card game

In an attempt to run statistics on the game and trying to find a "best" way to play the game,
this program is made to be a representation of Continental the card game. Rules,  players,  and
strategies are coded based on real-life rules and personal experience when it comes to player
strategy. 

This project is to help me and my skills in programming decision-making skills, conditional
rules, code flexibility, running statistics, finding trends, and finding real-world solutions.
